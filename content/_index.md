# Workshop: Deploy a PHP Phone Store Website on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Overview

This workshop will guide you step-by-step to **deploy a PHP-based phone store website** on AWS, using real-world cloud services such as Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, S3, CloudFront, Route 53, CloudWatch, and more.  
You'll learn how to prepare your code, upload the source, configure custom domains and SSL, optimize images, monitor logs, and manage operational costs efficiently.

There are two learning paths:

- **Option 1 (Basic):** Deploy the PHP website using Elastic Beanstalk, connect to an RDS database, open necessary ports, and test the website functionality.
- **Option 2 (Advanced):** Extend the system with a custom domain (Route 53), enable SSL/HTTPS (via ACM), optimize images/files using S3 + CloudFront, and monitor logs and alerts using CloudWatch.

**Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 to understand the basics of cloud web hosting on AWS, then move to Option 2 to optimize and professionalize your website.
